     FIXING VPS INSTALLATION ERROR
================================================================

ERROR MESSAGE:
--------------
services.api.environment.AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT contains true, 
which is an invalid type, it should be a string, number, or a null


ISSUE:
------
Docker Compose requires environment variables to be strings,
but boolean values (true/false) were used.


FIXED IN:
---------
✅ docker-compose.yml
   Changed: AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT: true
   To:      AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT: "true"


SOLUTION:
---------
The file has been fixed in the repository.

When you pull/clone again, it will work!


FOR IMMEDIATE FIX ON YOUR VPS:
-------------------------------
cd /var/www/balkly
nano docker-compose.yml

Find line with:
  AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT: true

Change to:
  AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT: "true"

Save and run:
  docker-compose up -d


OR:
---
Delete and reinstall:
  rm -rf /var/www/balkly
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XProject-hub/Balkly/main/install-vps.sh | sudo bash


STATUS:
